            An adult frog has a stout body, protuding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail(except in tailed frogs). Frogs have glandular 
            skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid paterns of 
            bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land, some species are adapted for living 
            underground or in trees.<br> <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>      </i> <i class="fa fa-retweet aria-hidden="true"></i>
